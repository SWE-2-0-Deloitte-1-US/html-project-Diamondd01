    <p class ="paragraph">I attended Kennesaw State University after High school and I majored in Biology. I did not have a good experience so I decided to end that journey once they sent us all home for covid.
         However, I still managed to find a way and network my way into a position at Amazon where I helped sellers who uploaded and stored their products with Amazon.
        While there I took small courses on using thins like Excel and AWS. 
        Then I decided to leave Amazon to work for Microsoft helping gamers recover their accounts. 
        While here I started to look into Azure. An opportunity came for me to take a coding bootcamp course where I'd learn HTML, CSS, and JS.
        At the time I had no interest in coding. I actually wanted to do digital marketing however , after the bootcamp I realized I enjoyed coding so much. 
        From there I got a sponsored to learn full stack web development by devMountain and an opportunity to interview for a position to work at perficient.
        I took the chance and quit my job at Microsoft because the program was full time.
        Once I joined the tech bootcamp I developed apps and learned about Java,SQL,APIs, JSON, Node.js , and so much more.
        After the bootcamp I got the opportunity through multiverse to work for deloitte.
        This is where this chapter ends and another begins. Stay tuned to see what else happens in the life of Nadiamond.
